I have been really busy finishing off some contract work, so I have not had much time to complete the Replay bringup.

I am ordering some more PCBs so I did a quick layout of a daughter board for the LCD. It has an analog joystick and some buttons.  Really, it's just to play with the LCD, although I might respin the replay board itself and put the LCD on the back so it could be made into a portable.
