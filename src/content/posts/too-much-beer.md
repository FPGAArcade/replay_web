It's been very sunny in Stockholm this week, so there has been much beer drinking and less time working on the bringup :)

I have made a minor patch to the board to fix the Chrontel power issues - still no word from them on this problem.  1080P and 720P output is working well, and I have made several measurements with a 40G scope to check out the board before production.

Below is one DVI channel, and I'm extremely happy with the quality of the eye pattern.

Next is to make some measurements of the DRAM signal quality.
