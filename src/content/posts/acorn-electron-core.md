A little over 34 years ago, Acorn Computers Ltd released a budget version of the BBC Micro, the Acorn Electron. For a time it was apparently the best selling Micro in the United Kingdom, although in more recent years the Electron seems to be overshadowed by its big brother the BBC Micro.

This often overlooked Micro is now available as a core for the Replay. The core is fully functional allowing hundreds of games and applications to be loaded from "cassette" including the revolutionary Elite, the game that for many changed everything. Development work is on-going to improve accuracy.
