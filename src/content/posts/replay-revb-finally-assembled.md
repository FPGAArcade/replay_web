A few more pictures now I've assembled the through hole components.

You can see one board does not have the components on the backside, this is the version without the composite/SVHS output. The board you can see from the top has the codec and the extra output connector. Note, I've stuck four rubber feet on the bottom over the mounting holes while I work on them - these are not fitted usually as it will be in a mini-itx case.
