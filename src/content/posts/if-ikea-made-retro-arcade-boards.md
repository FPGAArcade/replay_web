Sorry, living in Sweden I couldn't resist this. This is what a Replay parts kit looks like. This board is going off to another developer. Just to repeat, the production board will be available fully assembled only, you don't want to try and build this thing unless you have an SMD assembly machine handy, trust me.

I've been hitting the layout quite hard this week trying to finish off the daughter boards so I can get them all produced at the same time. This board contains a 68000 processor and some 5V capable expansion IO. I can wire up floppy disks, IDE disks or the 4.3" LCD touchscreen I have just ordered :) (Note, the bottom red layer is also a ground plane which isn't shown). 

The main card bringup is going well. I can boot the FPGA from the ARM. I am working on the menu system, as soon as I have something to show I'll post a video. Three boards are going off to other developers. As soon as I'm happy with the memory and video output I'll get the rest of the prototype boards populated (10). I'll then open it up to everybody who wants one and do a production run.

These IO cards are also available if anybody wants them.
