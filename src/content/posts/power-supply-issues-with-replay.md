A quick update, I apologize for the delay. I've been really busy testing the boards.

No real problems as yet. I'm waiting for a different LDO as the one I am using does not shut down when the input power is turned off, and the resulting reverse leakage keeps the board partially powered. I have modified one board with a different part which fixes the problem.

One other issue which is a bit more annoying is the audio connector is a bit close to the DVI connector. It works fine with most DVI cables, but some are a bit fat which means the 3.5mm jack bends. I have mounted the connector at a slight angle which helps...

I'll try and get some pictures and a video up of the board running some Amiga demos in the next few days.
