As the last entry was in May last year, I think some update is in order.

Simply, work went crazy and I moved flat in the summer last year - all of which conspired to push out the Replay board development sadly. I have got the production process in place now, and 100 boards are being assembled this week. Assuming all goes well, more will follow immediately. we have also developed a USB interface adapter for the Replay board. This replaces the PS2 connector and adds low latency keyboard / mouse USB support directly into the FPGA. This can be back-fitted to existing boards, and will be available as an option on new ones.

More news to follow ....
