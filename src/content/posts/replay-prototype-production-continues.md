Prototype board production is continuing. All beta test boards are assembled and these have been shipping out over the past week or two. I've been in China and should get the production tweaked version as well as the atx-power control PCB manufactured shortly. The atx-power board connects the power supply in a mini-itx box to the Replay board, and has a on-off controller so you can use the case power button to power the board up and down.

A couple of videos of the board running. Sorry about the focus and exposure problems, the camera gets a bit confused by the changes in screen brightness.

Some demos:
