I have ordered more of the 28pin Namco custom replacements, so these will be back in stock shortly.

I've also got my hands on the very nice [Xilinx Spartan3A board](http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xebiz/designResources/ip_product_details.jsp?key=HW-SPAR3A-SK-UNI-G) (thanks Eric) and it is pretty ideal for our gaming needs. I have Frogger and Scramble running but there are a few glitches that are taking a little longer to sort out than I imagined.
