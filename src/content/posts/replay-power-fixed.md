The replacement regulators work well and solve the power off problem. I've been testing the luma trap response with burst test patterns generated in the FPGA. The hardware is working well, but I am starting to think the trap may not be worth it for retro-computing. It softens the edges of the characters a little, but does reduce the colour distortion. It's easy to not fit the filter if we decide later it is not necessary.

Writing of production test is on going. DRAM is still not fully tested.
