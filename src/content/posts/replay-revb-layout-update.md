I have samples of the Chrontel DACs so I've decided to push on and build a few boards at least now. I've updated the schematic and layout drawings in the previous post and told the PCB house to re-process and complete the boards.

Waiting for the components has given me time to refine the layout a bit and I'm pretty happy with it. Lets hope it works ok :)

Some of the internal layers :
