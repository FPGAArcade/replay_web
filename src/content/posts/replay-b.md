I've completed the PCB library work for the new parts. This was a bit more complex that I expected as I had limited data on some of the connectors. I have placed everything on the board and am working on the routing now. We are still discussing some changes to the joystick ports, but once we have sorted that out I'll publish the new RevB schematic.
