We've bought a number of Ultra96 boards which contain a similar FPGA to the target device on Replay2. This will kick start development, especially on the Linux side. I'm also designing a small add-on board with the video output devices we'll use on the real board. This will allow us to run up some cores and make sure we are happy with the architecture, as well as letting me crack on with testing the new 68K core in the Amiga.
