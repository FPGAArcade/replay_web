Well, I still haven't got the new website up and running, but testing and shipping of the boards continues. I'm working through the list of people who have mailed me. I have a new Amiga core up and running based on Jakub's latest work, but it's not quite ready yet - I'm so busy testing boards.

I also got the IO shields back, they look rather nice :
