I have an original Replay1a board back for repair at the moment, so I thought I would take a picture of the family together.

R1a on the left. R1b next with the 68060 daughter board.

Top right the Arduino MKRVidor4000 we are targeting to be a low cost R1 replacement.

Bottom right the Zynq Ultrascale board which we are using to evaluating the SOC for R2. I'm currently designing a small expansion board which will let me test analogue and digital video out from the FPGA fabric.

Exciting times!
