Testing is going well, I have most of the boards assembled now.

I am starting to mail people who have already contacted me, and then I will see how many boards are left. I am about to order some more, so there should be plenty available. The first core to be released will be the Amiga AGA, but there are still some issues with this I am working on.

Updated schematics and mechanics files released.
