Rather busy here, I will be in Asia next week so I will get 50 or so boards made. These will be the RevB board which has a few minor tweaks, so I am trying to finish testing the prototype PCB. Still no support from Chrontel (who make the DAC) who are strangely uninterested. I have made some measurements of the DAC and have completed the PCB respin so I am confident we can go ahead, however we are looking at an alternative DAC vendor. 

PS2, Audio and Composite/SVHS out work fine - although the picture looks pretty poor compared to the 1080P HDMI output :) I am making some measurements of the DRAM interface now (I brought the big 'scope home for the weekend) - the last part to be verified.  So, we should have production ready boards really quite soon .....
