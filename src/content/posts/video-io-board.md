I've just been finishing off the layout of the 68K daughter board and the video IO board (pictured below) for the Replay card. The IO board contains audio RCA connectors, front mounted joystick and SVHS / composite video outputs.

These are needed to finish testing the main board before I can build some more. Testing of the main card is going well.
