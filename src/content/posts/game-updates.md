Arnim LÃ¤uger has updated some of the projects. Adventure Vision has been updated with a new T400 core. Colecovision and LadyBug have had the SN76489 audio chip updated.

The SN76489 and VDP19 (TMS9918A, TMS9928A,TMS9929A) cores from the designs have been repackaged and are available together with some short READMEs on the Librarys page.

Time to watch the Sweden England football game. As I am English and living in Sweden it should be interesting :)
