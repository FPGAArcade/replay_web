Right, returned from a brief holiday.

I've moved all the CAD projects and libraries over to my internal SVN repository. This was necessary to sync the work between the workstation and laptop, so I can get the daughter board and AGA debug board out to production.

Focus this week is shipping more boards, I know some of you are waiting patiently....

I'm also going to start adding project pages to this website, and see if I can fix a few more bugs in the Amiga core.

As always, check the forum for the latest gossip.
