Finally, after being stuck in Swedish customs for nearly a month (thanks PostNord), the PCB for my 40 pin Konami 503 ASIC replacement has arrived.

I'm experimenting with an Atmel 5V CPLD on these, rather than the old Altera MAX7064 which is getting hard to get, and rather expensive. The PCB is double sided with a nearly solid ground plane on the bottom for good signal integrity and power stability.

Assuming these new parts function as expected the completed modules should work out around 24Euros each.

I appear to have got a bit carried away when ordering these boards, so if you want any let me know!
