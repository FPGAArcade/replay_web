First of all, Happy Christmas and New Year to everyone.

Wow, another month has gone by already. This ASIC project I am working on has had some last minute hiccups, and I am still very busy working on that. Mid Jan will see it done I hope, and I am going back to China then.

So, the aim now is to get the RevB board layout complete in the next two weeks. Going to be tough, but I am now 5 months behind schedule so we need to pick up the pace again.
