Well, the summer holidays are over, the annual get (very) drunk at IBC been survived (just) so it is time for some new stuff.

I have released the Spartan3E port of the Bally Astrocade, you can get that on the Platforms page.

Sean Riddle found and fixed a bug in the T80 core, so there is a update to that on the Library page.

Sean has been working on a Space Invaders multigame on the Spartan3E board, and I will include that here as soon as possible.
