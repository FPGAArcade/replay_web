Here is a picture of the board in a mini-itx box. It's the smallest case I could find and the Replay board takes up about 1/3rd. I need to make a small adapter board for the ATX PSU then the board can be powered by the rear 4 pin molex.

The hardware is fully tested now and I'm starting to send out more boards to beta testers. I'm having a lot of fun playing around with the Amiga core. You can see below it running up 1.3 workbench. I'm producing a video of it running some demos and behaving as a A1200 with AGA chipset and 68020 processor.
