The RevB Replay PCB respin is taking shape. The main reason for doing this is to fix a Chrontel power issue. I've taken the opportunity to move the connectors to one side, and it has composite/SVHS output on the board as well now. The power has moved to the back,as if the card is in a mini-itx case you can use the molex connector.

All in all I'm pretty happy with it, it's a good improvement. The PCB is due to be made on Feb18, which is not far away now and I haven't quite finished the routing ....
