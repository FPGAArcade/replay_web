Good news, the missing connector which was on 3 month lead time has finally arrived! The components are packed and shipped off to the production people for the prototype assembly. The paste mask needed for assembly has also arrived, so we are good to go.

Hopefully I will have the first few boards to test late next week.

I was on a short trip to China again last week, and while you are waiting for board updates you can check out my friend Harry's website who has taken some great pictures from around China.
