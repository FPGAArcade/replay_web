I've finished the layout of the large patch card needed for testing with a real 68030 processor. The board is also used to test the IO on the main Replay card. The three daughter boards will go to manufacture tomorrow.

Four main boards are now in existence and have gone/going to developers. I've been busy getting all the components together for these.

I've been away for the weekend so not much other progress to report, but hopefully I can now focus on bringing up the main card :)
