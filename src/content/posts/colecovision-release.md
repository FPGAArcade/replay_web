Arnim LÃ¤uger has completed his implementation of Coleco's third generation video game console from 1982. This was the first console to feature Donkey Kong and sold over six million units. Arnim has tested the code with more than 50 games, so head over to the Platforms menu to have a play.

Oh, and Happy new year to all !

I have now got most of the kit over here in Sweden (including a computer) so hopefully I can finally complete everything I have started - before Arnim does everything :)
