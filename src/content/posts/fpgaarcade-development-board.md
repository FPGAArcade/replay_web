... is nearing completion (really, honest). Placement is complete and routing is going well. I hope to get some pictures up in a week or so. It is an ECX size board measuring about 14cm by 10cm and designed to fit in a case. 

It has a large Spartan3E Xilinx FPGA, quality audio and video output (including DVI) and a PIC based boot loader which is compatible with Dennis' Minimig. Final costings have yet to be completed, a lot depends on the size of the production run, but it will be "reasonable". 

The board will run my AtariST code as well as Minimig, and all the other games and platforms will be ported across. Finally, it has an expansion connector which can take IO cards. A Jamma one is being designed at the moment allowing the board to slot into real arcade cabinets. I am also considering a vector monitor output card for Asteroids and StarWars games. You really couldn't have more fun without taking your clothes off.... 

In other news the FPGAArcade website will be moving to a proper server soon which will allow a support & discussion forum. Testing is ongoing.
