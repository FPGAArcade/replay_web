While there is a lot of exciting new stuff going on, I'm still trying to finish off some old commitments.

Thanks to some CAD help from the team and the fantastic guys in Taiwan we have received the laser cut ATX I/O panels.

Contact me if you want one. It only fits on B2 boards (not 1.0B) without modification. If you have a previous I/O shield, this one will also fit.

(Note in the picture below I've not got the board screwed together so the holes are not quite aligned)
