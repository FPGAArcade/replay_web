A brief update to say the video output is working well. I've tested DVI -> HDMI at 576i/50Hz (Pal) and analog out with a DVI to VGA cable. Both work fine, although I am upset that the M227WD TV chops off the outer few pixels in HDMI mode - but they are there in analog mode.

I will implement some other standards, 480i/60Hz (NTSC) and the progressive versions. I think the default menu screen will be 480i/60Hz or 720P/60Hz to give most compatibility.
