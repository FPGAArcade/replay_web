At long last (almost two years) I have completed the Scramble / Frogger code - I am easily distracted! The hardware is very similar, so I have added a compile time switch to allow it to run both games. Many other games can be run on this hardware, so I am sure a multigame will be produced at some point. 

This is the most advanced FPGA game yet featuring two Z80 cores, two 8910 sounds chips and two 8255 PIA chips. 

I am heading of to the Glastonbury music festival next week where I will probably forget who I am, so I thought it was a good idea to get this release out before I went :) 

The source code can be found on the games page.
