Well, just about. Glastonbury was amazing, but now I've sobered up, flown home and I have been busy testing boards all day.

I received an update from the Mist guys (we work on the 68K CPU together) and have updated the Amiga core. Still some issues, but moving forward.

I'll be spending the next few days working on the website and sorting out how we do releases and handle versions. I'm also working on porting the remaining cores, and waiting for the AGA debug board (with real chips on) to come back so I can finish the Amiga core 'tuning'.
