The Philips Videopac G7000 (or Odyssey2 as it was known in America) was released in 1978 to compete with other cartridge based systems such as the Atari VCS. Powered by an Intel 8048 CPU and a custom Intel IC known as a Video Display Controller (VDC) generating all sound and video. The console did relatively well with more than 60 cartridges being made available. 

Arnim LÃ¤uger has completed an FPGA implementation of the console, and the design can be found on the Platforms page, full source code provided as always.
