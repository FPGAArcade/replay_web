Well, so far so good with the testing of the Replay board. The power supplies are all working well with good phase margin. I can configure the FPGA through the JTAG interface and flash the LEDs, so the clock generator is also working. I can find the ARM with the USB connection and configure it. The next step is to finish the boot code and configure the FPGA from the SD card.
