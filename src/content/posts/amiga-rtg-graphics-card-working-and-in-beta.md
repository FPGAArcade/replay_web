The latest Amiga AGA core is in beta with support for P96 compatible RTG. It also includes a hardware blitter engine which is used by the card driver to speed up window movements.

There is still work to do increasing the pixel clock, but it's nice to see these modes working cleanly over DVI/HDMI. Thanks especially to Jim Drew for work on the driver.

See the forum for more details.
