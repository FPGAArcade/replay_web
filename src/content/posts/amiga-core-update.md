I've been testing a new version of my Amiga AGA core. It's checked into the private repository. I'm working this week to make binary releases (and source ASAP) on the public mirror.

Â 

The MIST AGA project has received some great updates recently, and I keep getting asked if I will pick up those fixes.

The answer is "no" - the code base is (mostly) different and I don't have those bugs in. I may have different ones of course.

I am setting up a bug tracking system on here next so beta testers can log issues and I'll fix them.

One thing we do work on together is the T68K CPU. So far I submitted one fix and received one fix back. Unfortunately Slam Tilt AGA still does not work on my core, and I am investigating.

Still testing and shipping boards, although I am having a few days holiday this week and I thank you for your continuing patience !
