Well, summer is now over and it's time to crack on with the FPGA work. I'm still busy repairing the last few boards, and work is well under way on the daughterboard and new production run.

I've been chatting with a couple of guys over on atari-forum regarding the Atari ST ASICs.

http://www.chzsoft.de/asic-web/ has been able to print out some of the ASIC drawings found in an Atari archive. I'm working with him to see what's useful, and contributing my work back. I'll stick it all in the public SVN asap.
 
Finally, here's a super die scan of the MMU C0205912-38 by Ijor.
