I'll just sneak in a little update while it is still August :)

Well, late July didn't happen never mind early July. All of Sweden seems to shut down during the summer, and getting a production slot has proved difficult. However, we are going ahead now. If the missing connector arrives this week we could have boards next week, but more likely mid-September.

The exchange rates are all over the place, and until I get the boards in my hand these prices are subject to change.

Full card (with SVHS/Composite out) is looking like 220Euro today. The "light" card without SVHS/composite is 200Euro.

The bad news is I have to pay sales tax here on the first boards, so that's an additional 25%. I'll include a EU plug power supply for the first 50 boards. Being totally honest up-front, boards after the first 50 will be at least 25% cheaper and sales tax will be payable on import if you are outside the EU so thats another 25% saved.

Oh, I survived Glastonbury festival - it was fantastic.
