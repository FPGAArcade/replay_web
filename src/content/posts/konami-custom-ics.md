Well, it's been a little while since I last posted any news.

I have completed the four Atari ST ASICs and am co-simulating them. I am in final stages of designing a low cost FPGA platform which will be ideal for the games, but also for running the Atari and Amiga (MiniMig) FPGA clones on. It has an expansion connector into which a JAMMA connector will plug for use in real arcade boxes, or for experimentation. I am also considering an analogue output card so the vector games can drive real monitors. The card will be available for purchase, but don't hold your breath as I have been getting around to this for a few years. 

In the meantime, happy Christmas to you all.
