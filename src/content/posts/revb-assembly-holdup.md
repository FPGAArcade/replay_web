The RevB Replay PCB is waiting in China for some parts. For some reason a number of components are on two month lead time at the moment, which is a bit annoying. I'm trying to get samples of the missing parts so I can at least populate a few proto boards to test here in Sweden.

I have quite a lot of most parts already though...
