I survived the mud at Glastonbury Festival! Had a superb time, met lots of great people. 

Right, there is no way round it, I am going to have to write a DDR memory controller for the Spartan3E board. The ones that are out there are not flexible/high performance enough for my Asteroid needs, and I cannot modify and redistribute the Xilinx MIG code. Once this is completed, Defender can be finished and StarWars is next ....
