Well, I was away for a little longer than expected, then got Flu and then went to Amsterdam so I now need a bit of recovery time :) 

The idea was to get the boards assembled in China, but having talked to the other developers they really wanted a few changes in the way the joystick ports are used.

Having the daughter board made this difficult. I found while I was in China some stacking connectors which means I can move most of the IO to one side of the card. The SVHS/Composite is still optional, but is now a build option. This means most people won't need the expansion board so the board to board connectors do not need to be fitted to the entry level board.

It would look something like this :

I didn't get the PCB changes done in time, so I had to bring home a whole load of components ...

I am working on the layout changes now and hope to finish and get the boards made next week.
