I was a bit upset that the Spartan3E starter kit from Xilinx has only single bit RGB on its VGA connector. This is a real limitation when running the games on the board - so I have modified it. I have documented the changes required, and have released some VGA test pattern generator code which will allow you to test the modification.

I wasn't really sure where to put it, so it is on the Platforms page under DisplayTest for now. (at the bottom)
