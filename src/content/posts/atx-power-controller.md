Ok, not quite the last post in the old website ... I've just got back from another fantastic Glastonbury Festival, so it's a bit of an effort to do, well, anything this week :)

I built one of the atx\_pwr controller boards and it works nicely. Now my board is in it's ITX case, so I can move it around a bit easier. The FPGAs for the next production run have not arrived yet sadly, I'm chasing them.

The power adapter board is plugged directly into the ATX PSU

Normally a connector would be fitted on the controller board and then it could be placed anywhere convenient
